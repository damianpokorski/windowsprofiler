# About
This is a very old project of mine that I have abandoned years ago, serves as a good reminer of how bad my programming skills were. I wrote this sometime during my 2nd year of college. 

Goal of this project was to create profiles which would specify exactly where each window would be located, this way even if windows were moved, you could quickly restore their previous position.

Or maybe you had a few different workflows and wanted to just switch inbetween the states? Dunno. Honestly no clue what past me was thinking.
